ROCKBUSTER 

Rockbuster Stealth LLC used to operate movie rental stores across the globe. However, with the advent of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, the company is facing tough competition. To tackle this challenge, the management team has decided to leverage its existing movie licenses by launching an online video rental service. 
This move is aimed at helping Rockbuster Stealth stay relevant and competitive in the market.
